# 2-Responsive-Portfolio
A mobile responsive portfolio

# To Do

* Style personal brand css sheet.
<!-- * Create a media query that eliminates margins as it gets to sx. -->
<!-- * Create a media query that makes content disapear when it gets too small possibly combined with above? -->
<!-- * Add links and photos to portfolio. -->
* Write a good README.
* make sure all html is semantic and makes sense.
<!-- * Create a sticky footer. -->
* Find out what sub-columns and sub-rows are and implement them on Portfolio page.
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

### Hints

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
