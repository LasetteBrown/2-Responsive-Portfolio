# 2-Responsive-Portfolio

A mobile responsive portfolio to display my prowess as a full stack web developer, with which I hope to woo potential employers and earn the respect of fellow developers.

## Purpose and Scope

This portfolio is meant to be a online homepage for me as a web developer. It includes information about me and my path towards web development as a career, links to projects that I have worked on and any apps that I have developed, and a contact page for getting in touch with me.

The portfolio was designed with mobile usage in mind and is meant to be responsive to the size of the viewing screen.

## Process

This website was developed as a homework assignment for the University of Denver Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp (https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/). I was given images as guides for what this websight could look like. I began by attempting to replicate the images exactly so that I could develope my skills in matching a product to the requested design. 

For example I was given the following images:
![Alt text](/assets/images/992-index.png "example of homepage on large screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/768-index.png "example of homepage on medium screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/400-index.png "example of homepage on small screen")

and I created the following pages based on this example:
![Alt text](/assets/images/992-index-actual.png "my homepage on large screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/768-index-actual.png "my homepage on medium screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/400-index-actual.png "my homepage on small screen")

For example I was given the following image:
![Alt text](/assets/images/992-portfolio.png "example of portfolio page on large screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/768-portfolio.png "example of portfolio page on medium screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/400-portfolio.png "example of portfolio page on small screen")

and I created the following page based on this example:
![Alt text](/assets/images/992-portfolio-actual.png "my portfolio page on large screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/768-portfolio-actual.png "my portfolio page on medium screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/400-portfolio-actual.png "my portfolio page on small screen")

For example I was given the following image:
![Alt text](/assets/images/992-contact.png "example of contact page on large screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/768-contact.png "example of contact page on medium screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/400-contact.png "example of contact page on small screen")

and I created the following page based on this example:
![Alt text](/assets/images/992-contact-actual.png "my contact page on large screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/768-contact-actual.png "my contact page on medium screen")
![Alt text](/assets/images/400-contact-actual.png "my contact page on small screen")



### In Development (As in things I still have to do)

* Style personal brand css sheet.
* make sure all html is semantic and makes sense.
* Find out what sub-columns and sub-rows are and implement them on Portfolio page.
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.
* Must use semantic html.
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
